Discord Music Bot 

I wasnt happy with discord disallowing music bots, therefore I made one myself.

    🎵 Music Playback: Stream audio in voice channels using ffmpeg.

    🧩 Cog-Based Architecture: Organize commands and listeners into separate modules for better code management.

    📂 JSON Data Handling: Utilize json_handling.py for efficient data storage and retrieval.

    🔧 Extensible Design: Easily add new features and commands by creating additional cogs.
